# webcamproject  
It was a freelance project for a student in Korea National University of Arts for the graduation project.  
The project was about a social experiment of sharing people's moments in the cafe through a webcam, to express the opinions about the area(mostly about safety in the area).  
The main goal was to develop in a very short amount of time(less than 1~2 weeks) to provide a minimum working prototype for the graduation project showcase.
